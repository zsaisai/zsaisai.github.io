Hi there, I am a postgraduate student 👨‍🎓 from School of Computer Science,  North China Electric Power University .

I am generally interested in **data mining and machine learning**, especially recommendation system, with supervised, AutoML or transfer learning approaches. And I focus on using latest techniques to build machines that collecting, analyzing and using data, help humans to find their favorite items, detect patterns and mining interesting results.

Please feel free to **[contact me📧](z_ss101@163.com)**, thanks!
