Hi there, I am a postgraduate student 👨‍🎓 from School of Computer Science,  North China Electric Power University .

I am generally interested in **data mining and machine learning**, especially recommendation system, with supervised, AutoML or transfer learning approaches. And I focus on using latest techniques to build machines that collecting, analyzing and using data, help humans to find their favorite items, detect patterns and mining interesting results.
